# Pokemons API Challenge

#### To complete this task I used:
* `create-react-app` with `typescript`;
* `redux` to store data;
* `redux-thunk` to handle async requests;
* `redux-persist` to persist search results;
* `lodash` to delay searching process;

#### What can be changed:
* Not all of the types was propperly described because it could took too much time. Of course this is the thing to improve;
* Also can be added selecting number of Pokemons to display (instead of hardcoded 16);
* More functionality for navigation (eg. total number of pages);
* Single page for each pokemon with their data;
* In this variant no special styles used. So this thing can be changed too;

#### To run project at localhost
